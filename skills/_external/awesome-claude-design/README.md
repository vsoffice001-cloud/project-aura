# Awesome Claude Design

Upload any `DESIGN.md` to Claude Design and it scaffolds a full design system (colors, type, components, preview cards, and a working UI kit) in a single shot. 

Skip the blank-page design brief, grab a design system inspiration that matches the feel you want, and let Claude Design do the scaffolding.


## What is Claude Design?

[Claude Design](https://claude.ai/design) is Anthropic's new design-focused workspace. Instead of generating one-off screens in a chat window, it holds a persistent **design system** for your project: tokens, components, and preview assets you can actually ship, not just swatches in a chat window.

You give it a starting point (an aesthetic, a vibe, or a `DESIGN.md`), and it scaffolds the system: color tokens, type scale, buttons, cards, nav, and a working UI kit. The output lands in the project's Design System review tab, organized and inspectable, so every new screen you request stays on-system.

## What is DESIGN.md?

[`DESIGN.md`](https://getdesign.md/what-is-design-md) is a single plain-text markdown file that describes a brand's visual language in a format AI agents can actually act on. The concept was first introduced by Google Stitch and built into a real, comparable collection by at 🎨[**getdesign.md**](https://getdesign.md/). 

> The core idea: keep **token, rule, and rationale in the same file**. A Figma export tells you *what* to use but skips *why*. A brand guideline PDF talks to humans ("approachable yet premium") but is too loose for an agent. `DESIGN.md` sits in the middle. Specific enough for the agent to make its next decision, and carrying the *why* so it can stay on-system when it hits a case the file never covered.

| File | Who reads it | What it defines |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Coding agents | How to build the project |
| `DESIGN.md` | Design agents (Claude Design, Stitch …) | How the project should look and feel |

Claude Design can use `DESIGN.md` as its source of truth. Hand it one, and the full starter package falls out the other side.

## How it works



1. Pick a design system inspiration from the list below, click through to its preview page to inspect the system in detail, then download its `DESIGN.md`.
2. Open [Claude Design](https://claude.ai/design). You've got **two ways** to feed it the file:

### Option A. Start from a design system

   Go to [claude.ai/design/#org](https://claude.ai/design/#org), click **Create new design system**, and on the *Set up your design system* screen, upload the `DESIGN.md` under **Add assets**.

![setup-a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93846ec2-c159-4459-b434-8acb7ac5fcfe)


<br/>

### Option B. Start from a prototype
   Go to dashboard, create a new prototype, attach the `DESIGN.md` in the chat, and type: **"Create a design system from this DESIGN.md"**


<img width="848" height="480" alt="option-b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7e3c22c-fd3d-41a2-a6d0-1a50b40e22c9" />




Either way, Claude produces a full starter package in minutes:

- `README.md` with brand context, voice, and visual foundations
- `colors_and_type.css` with CSS variables, type scale, utility classes
- Google Fonts substitutes when the brand font is proprietary
- `preview/` cards for colors, type, spacing, components, and brand
- A working UI kit (`index.html` + components) applying the system to a real marketing page
- `SKILL.md`, a portable skill file for future projects

One markdown file → production-ready design package. No boilerplate, no manual setup.

## What Claude produces from a DESIGN.md

Each file gives Claude enough structured context to generate a complete, opinionated system, not a loose color grab. The 9 sections every `DESIGN.md` follows:

| # | Section | What Claude reads it for |
|---|---------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Visual Theme & Atmosphere | Setting tone, density, and mood of the scaffold |
| 2 | Color Palette & Roles | Emitting CSS variables with semantic names + hex |
| 3 | Typography Rules | Building the type scale and picking Google Fonts fallbacks |
| 4 | Component Stylings | Generating buttons, inputs, cards, nav with states |
| 5 | Layout Principles | Spacing scale, grid, whitespace rhythm |
| 6 | Depth & Elevation | Shadow tokens and surface hierarchy |
| 7 | Do's and Don'ts | Guardrails Claude respects when generating new screens |
| 8 | Responsive Behavior | Breakpoints, touch targets, collapse behavior |
| 9 | Agent Prompt Guide | Reusable prompts Claude embeds into the generated `SKILL.md` |

## Tips for getting better output

- **Start in a fresh project.** Claude Design anchors the system to the project it was scaffolded in. Mixing brands mid-project muddles the tokens.
- **Keep asking for screens.** Once the system is scaffolded, prompts like *"now build a pricing page"* or *"add an empty state"* stay on-brand automatically.
- **Request variants.** Ask for light/dark, compact/comfortable, or marketing/app variants. Claude branches cleanly from the base tokens.
- **Export the `SKILL.md`.** Save it to your own skills folder and you can re-summon the same aesthetic in any future Claude project without re-uploading.
